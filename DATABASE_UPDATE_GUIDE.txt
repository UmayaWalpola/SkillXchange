DATABASE STRUCTURE UPDATE - PROJECT APPLICATIONS
====================================================

## STEP 1: Update Database Structure

Run this SQL in phpMyAdmin SQL tab to add the new application detail fields:

```sql
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `experience` LONGTEXT NULL AFTER `message`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `skills` LONGTEXT NULL AFTER `experience`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `contribution` LONGTEXT NULL AFTER `skills`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `commitment` VARCHAR(100) NULL AFTER `contribution`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `duration` VARCHAR(100) NULL AFTER `commitment`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `motivation` LONGTEXT NULL AFTER `duration`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `portfolio` VARCHAR(500) NULL AFTER `motivation`;

ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD INDEX `idx_applied_at` (`applied_at`);
```

## STEP 2: Database Schema

After running the SQL above, your `project_applications` table will have this structure:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| id | int | Primary key |
| project_id | int | FK to projects |
| user_id | int | FK to users |
| message | text | Compatibility field (notes) |
| experience | LONGTEXT | Applicant's relevant experience |
| skills | LONGTEXT | How applicant's skills match project |
| contribution | LONGTEXT | Specific contributions they'll make |
| commitment | VARCHAR(100) | Time per week (5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30+) |
| duration | VARCHAR(100) | Duration involvement (1-3m, 3-6m, 6-12m, ongoing) |
| motivation | LONGTEXT | Why they're interested in project |
| portfolio | VARCHAR(500) | Link to portfolio/GitHub |
| status | enum | pending, accepted, rejected |
| applied_at | timestamp | Application timestamp |
| reviewed_at | timestamp | When application was reviewed |

## STEP 3: What Changed in Code

### Controllers: ProjectApplicationController.php
- New method `apply()` now validates all form fields
- Calls new model method `applyToProjectAdvanced()`
- Stores each field separately in database

### Models: Project.php
- New method: `applyToProjectAdvanced()` 
  - Stores experience, skills, contribution, commitment, duration, motivation, portfolio separately
  - Prevents duplicate applications
  - Returns success/failure

- Updated method: `getAllApplicationsForOrganization()`
  - Now retrieves all new fields from database
  - Passes them to organization applications view

### Views: organization/applications.php
- Displays detailed application sections:
  - 📚 Relevant Experience
  - 🛠️ Skills Match  
  - 💡 How They'll Contribute
  - 🎯 Motivation
  - ⏱️ Time Commitment & 📅 Duration
  - 🔗 Portfolio Link
  - Additional Notes (from message field)

### Styling: organizations.css
- New `.app-details` container with styled sections
- `.detail-section` for each application detail
- `.detail-section.inline` for side-by-side display
- `.portfolio-link` for clickable portfolio URLs
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## STEP 4: Test the New System

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Login as individual user
3. Navigate to any project detail page
4. Click "Apply to Join This Project"
5. Fill out all fields in the advanced form
6. Submit application
7. Login as organization
8. Go to /organization/applications
9. View the detailed application with all sections displayed beautifully

## STEP 5: Old Applications

Existing applications in your database will still show with just the message field. 
New applications submitted after the database update will show all detailed fields.

To migrate old data, you could write a script to parse the old combined messages, but 
users can simply reapply with new applications to get the detailed format.
