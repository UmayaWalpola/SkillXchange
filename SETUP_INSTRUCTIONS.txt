🚀 HOW TO UPDATE YOUR DATABASE AND TEST THE SYSTEM
==================================================

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Update Database

### Option 1: phpMyAdmin (Easiest)

1. Open phpMyAdmin in browser
2. Navigate to `skillxchange` database
3. Click the "SQL" tab at the top
4. Copy and paste THIS SQL code:

```sql
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `experience` LONGTEXT NULL AFTER `message`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `skills` LONGTEXT NULL AFTER `experience`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `contribution` LONGTEXT NULL AFTER `skills`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `commitment` VARCHAR(100) NULL AFTER `contribution`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `duration` VARCHAR(100) NULL AFTER `commitment`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `motivation` LONGTEXT NULL AFTER `duration`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD COLUMN `portfolio` VARCHAR(500) NULL AFTER `motivation`;
ALTER TABLE `project_applications` ADD INDEX `idx_applied_at` (`applied_at`);
```

5. Click "Go" button
6. Wait for "Query executed successfully" message

### Option 2: File Upload
- Find file: `database/migrations/alter_project_applications.sql`

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Form doesn't show new fields?**
A: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) and refresh page

**Q: Database update failed?**
A: Check for SQL syntax errors or column name conflicts
   - Make sure you're in correct database
   - Check column names don't already exist

**Q: Applications not showing in dashboard?**
A: Verify you:
   1. Ran the SQL ALTER TABLE statements
   2. Are logged in as organization that owns the projects
   3. Have pending applications in database

**Q: Applications showing but no details?**
A: New applications submitted AFTER database update will show details
   Old applications only have the message field
